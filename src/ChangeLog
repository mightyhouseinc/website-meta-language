       Remove trailing newline.
       [Ralf Vissers <ravis@web.de>]

       Some argument checks were missing in <array-shift> and could
       cause memory fault.
       [Jean-Michel Sauvage <jms.debian@club-internet.fr>]

    *) Upgrade to mp4h 1.3.0 (18-Oct-2002):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix ePerl compilation (17-Oct-2002):
       Perl 5.8.0 has now thread support by default, which caused trouble
       when compiling ePerl.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Renamed 'aux' directory to 'data' (12-Oct-2002):
       Allows WML to be compiled under Cygwin.
       [Claus Faerber]

    *) Use '.' instead of '::' for man pages on Windows (12-Oct-2002):
       Allows WML to be compiled under Cygwin.

       [Darryl Smith <Darryl@radio-active.net.au>]

    *) Fix wml::sup::path (16-Jun-2002):
       canonpath('.///') did return '/' instead of './'
       [Florian Hars]

    *) Improve checks on file errors (20-Apr-2002):
       In passes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 (ie Perl passes), file operations are
       checked and WML aborts if an error is detected.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove freetable comments in wml::fmt::xtable (10-Feb-2002):
       The -w flag now prints comments before generated table, whereas
       it used to omit it.  It is then omitted on freetable command line.
       [Thomas R. Koll <tomk32@tomk32.de>]

    *) Fix wml_p1_ipp (21-Dec-2001):
       Text added to let pass 3 retrieve filename and line numbers are
       protected against pass 2, because brackets could cause some trouble.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::des::typography (21-Dec-2001):
       The <spaced> tag could add ``&nbsp;'' within tags when interchar
       attribute was used.
       [Alvise Belotti]

    *) Fix wml::sup::path (18-Dec-2001):
       The canonpath function in wml::sup::path was buggy if path contains
       dots in directory names.
       [Tommi Vainikainen <thv@iki.fi>]

    *) Suppress warning in wml::std::toc (07-Nov-2001):
       A warning about wrong <preserve>/<restore> pairs could be raised
       when redefining <toc_section>, this is a long-standing bug which
       is revealed by an extra check added in recent mp4h.
       [Werner Heuser]

    *) Fix generic attributes in wml::des::navbar (05-Nov-2001):
       They were not always taken into account.
       [Clemens Oertel <oertel@uni-tuebingen.de>]

  Changes between 2.0.7 and 2.0.8:

    Note: since WML 2.0.5 there were two versions, stable and unstable.
          The former was numbered 2.0.N whereas the latter was 2.1aN.
          But I do not have time to manage those two separate trees,
          and there was no real benefit, so I am leaving this scheme.

    *) Fix locales in ePerl (28-Oct-2001):
       Locales broke ePerl with Perl > 5.6, with an odd error message:
       ``DynaLoader object version 1.04 does not match $DynaLoader::VERSION
       1 at DynaLoader.pm ...''
       [Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>, Axel Beckert]

    *) Upgrade to linklint 2.3.5 (28-Oct-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Cleanup wml::des::navbar (26-Oct-2001):
       The urlopts attribute in navbar:define was documented but not
       implemented, it is replaced by generic attributes.
       [Werner Heuser <wehe@snafu.de>]

    *) Fix -W description in wmk usage summary (23-Oct-2001):
       [Martin Quinson <Martin.Quinson@ens-lyon.fr>]

    *) Upgrade to mp4h 1.2.2 (18-Oct-2001):
       Among other new features, the most significant for WML users
       may be the ability to define entities (in the SGML or XML sense)
       which could be seen as empty tags without attributes, and an
       experimental support of utf8,
       Note also that a leading space has been added to expansion of
       <attributes-quote> to ease writing HTML tags.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix detection of Perl modules (02-Oct-2001):
       Previous detection did use the Exporter::require_version method,
       which cause problem when modules are not setup with Exporter.
       New scheme only rely on normal `use MODULE VERSION' Perl function.
       [Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>]

    *) Undefine variables on command-line (29-Sep-2001):
       Special construct -Dfoo=UNDEF undefine foo, if it was previously
       set by other command line options.  This is especially useful
       in .wmlrc files
       [Jan Holler]

    *) Upgrade wml_contrib/wml.vim (29-Sep-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve wml_p5_divert (09-Sep-2001):
       This pass could be very slow with large files.
       [Jean-Michel Sauvage]

    *) Fix documentation (26-Aug-2001):
       There was a documentation bug with example defining the <mail2>
       tag.
       [Rajendra Gokhale <rvg@creato.org>]

    *) Fixed various typos in manual pages (26-Aug-2001):
       Fixed various typos in manual pages wml_faq, wml::std::page
       and wml::std::info.
       [Thomas Lotterer <thomas.lotterer@cw.com>]

    *) Fix <protect> (17-Jul-2001):
       The pass= attribute is now case-insensitive.
       [Axel Beckert]

  Changes between 2.0.6 and 2.0.7:

    Note: timestamps have a single value because this 2.0.x branch did
          not receive support for a long time, so it has been decided
          to copy WML 2.1a2 into 2.0.7.

    *) Change <tli> in wml::des::typography (20-Jun-2001):
       It becomes a complex tag, as stated in documentation.
       [Craig Small]

    *) Fix compilation of Bit::Vector with perl < 5.005 (20-Jun-2001):
       Apply the 2001-08-29 patch by Max H. Duenki.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix nested ePerl tags implementation (19-Jun-2001):
       When <perl:assign> surrounds <perl:print>, output was not
       diverted to variables.  Quoting has also been fixed.
       [Petr Andreyev]

    *) Upgraded to Image::Size 2.93 (19-Jun-2001):
       Upgraded from 2.903 to 2.93
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_p7_htmlfix (19-Jun-2001):
       When replacing <center> tags, it did not work if this tag has
       attributes.
       [Andreas Hoffmann]

    *) Fix wml::fmt::verbatim (19-Jun-2001):
       The <verbatim> tag could not be used in conjunction with
       wml::std::case,
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Fix diversion (19-Jun-2001):
       Parent dirs `..' could cause problems.
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Upgraded to Bit::Vector 6.0 (19-Jun-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix protection (19-Jun-2001):
       When both stdout and file names are specified by -o flags,
       unprotection was not performed on standard output.
       [Aymeric Poulain-Maubant <Aymeric.PoulainMaubant@jipo.com>]

    *) Update wml_contrib/wml.spec.in (19-Jun-2001):
       File wml_contrib/wml.spec was always outdated, so this new spec
       file allows automatic update, just run `make wml_contrib/wml.spec'.
       [Christian W. Zuckschwerdt]

    *) Fixed wml::std::href (19-Jun-2001):
       Removed extra newline after </a>.
       [Jean-Michel Sauvage]

    *) Fixed wml::std::page (19-Jun-2001):
       Multiple pages capabilities was broken.
       [Jean-Michel Sauvage <jean-michel.sauvage@club-internet.fr>]

    *) Fixed wml::des::preload (19-Jun-2001):
       Javascript code was broken.
       [Andreas Hoffmann <hoffmana@mathematik.tu-muenchen.de>]

    *) Remove special characters in debugging output (19-Jun-2001):
       [Axel Beckert <rse-wml@deuxchevaux.org>]

    *) New <disjoin> tag (19-Jun-2001):
       This tag does the opposite job of <group>, it explodes its
       attribute into several pieces.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix bug with body tag surrounded by quotes (19-Jun-2001):
       When a body function was surrounded within double quotes (without
       any whitespace around), it was simply discarded.
       [Petr Andreyev]

    *) New logos (19-Jun-2001):
       These new logos are about NetBSD, OpenBSD, PHP and XEmacs.
       [Wolfgang Dautermann]

    *) Upgraded to txt2html 1.28 (19-Jun-2001):
       The bug described just below has been fixed in txt2html 1.28, so
       changes in wml::fmt::text have been discarded.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::fmt::text (19-Jun-2001):
       Some characters are missing when text is not finished by a
       newline.  There are indeed some bugs in wml_aux_txt2html, so
       a workaround is to ensure there is always a newline in
       wml::fmt::text.
       [Frediano Ziglio <freddy77@angelfire.com>]

    *) Change transparency in wml::des::imgdot (19-Jun-2001):
       By default, transparency color was set to black.  Unfortunately,
       some browsers do not render transparent PNG images, and black
       backgrounds are not so frequent anymore. Default is now set to
       white, and may be changed by prepending an hyphen to the color
       attribute.
       [Craig Small <csmall@eye-net.com.au>]

    *) Improve wml_p5_divert (19-Jun-2001):
       Make a distinction betwwen URLs like `../foo' and diversion like
       ..NAME>> to improve speed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve wml::des::navbar (19-Jun-2001):
       Any attributes can be added to <a> and <img> tags generated by
       <navbar::render>.  For instance it allows insertion of CSS
       attributes without having to modify wml::des::navbar.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve wml_p7_htmlfix (19-Jun-2001):
       Trailing spaces in tags are fixed, i.e. all spaces before a
       right-angle bracket are removed (this have no influence on
       known server-side scripts) and a space is always inserted before
       ``/>'' to help rendering of XHTML documents by old browsers.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix bugs with conditionals (19-Jun-2001):
       The <if>, <ifeq> and <ifneq> conditionals do not behave properly.
       Under rare circumstances, both THEN and ELSE clauses may be run.
       [Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>]

    *) Fix nested ePerl tags implementation (19-Jun-2001):
       When <perl> tags are nested and are not enclosed within space
       characters, some output disappear.
       [Petr Andreyev <petr@xanadu.ru>]

    *) Fix wml::des::navbar (19-Jun-2001):
       When rendering tables, <navbar:jsfuncs/> is called even if navbar
       is not graphical, to make sure JavaScript functions used for
       rollover effect are always defined.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade ePerl to current CVS version (19-Jun-2001):
       [Ralf S. Engelschall, Denis Barbier]

    *) New `all except' operator in slice terms (29-Oct-2000):
       The wildcard sign accepts a new syntax.  When followed by braces,
       it replaces ``all strings but the one enclosed within braces''.
       This construct could not be emulated with previous operators with
       nested slices.
       This feature was introduced in Slice 1.3.7 on August 2000, but
       required few fixes to work with WML.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 2.0.5 and 2.0.6:

    *) Fix WMk (25-Oct-2000):
       This version of WMk is broken and cannot compile multilingual
       documents.
       [Max H. Duenki]

  Changes between 2.0.4 and 2.0.5:

    *) Improve wml::std::page (23-Oct-2000):
       Add an attribute ``color=none'' to remove color attributes in
       the <body> tag.
       [Wayne Schlitt <wayne@midwestcs.com>]

    *) Improve WMd customization (13-Oct-2000):
       The 02-May-2000 patch is improved, mapping is now done via an
       external file, so that wmd script needs no more being updated.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add wml_contrib/wml1to2 (02-Oct-2000):
       This script helps upgrading to WML 2.x by performing some
       changes in input files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::des::navbar (02-Oct-2000):
       The $menumode Perl variable was not initialized.
       [Anthony Fok]

    *) Improve flags handling (02-Oct-2000):
       Some flags require an argument, which is now quoted in case this
       argument contains spaces or shell metacharacters.
       [Albert Reiner <areiner@tph.tuwien.ac.at>]

    *) Fix infinite loop in wml_p8_htmlstrip (28-Sep-2000):
       WML hangs up when large text blocks are surrounded by
       <pre>...</pre> or similar tags.
       [Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>]

    *) Fix wml_p8_htmlstrip (27-Sep-2000):
       The <pre> and <xmp> tags were always converted to lowercase
       letters.
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Fix compilation on AIX 4.3 (27-Sep-2000):
       The GD library did not compile because two unused routines depend
       upon undefined ones.  These useless routines are now removed.
       [Norbert Gruener <nog@mpa-garching.mpg.de>]

    *) Fix bug with conditionals in wml_p2_mp4h (27-Sep-2000):
       The <if> and <while> tags have strange results when first
       argument has a trailing slash, which is surely not so frequent.
       [Sebastian Wilhelmi <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>]

  Changes between 2.0.3 and 2.0.4:

    *) Fix wml::mod::MakeMaker (19-Sep-2000):
       The `extradistfiles' attribute did not work.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix problems with synclines and protection (19-Sep-2000):
       The `synclines' feature was not documented in WML 2.0.3.
       It helps debugging by putting some special commands after
       pass 1 to keep track of input line numbers.
       Unfortunately, these extra commands will remain on output when
       included file is inside a protected area.
       This problem is now documented, and 2 solutions exist: either
       compile with `-W1,-N', or append the `IPP_NOSYNCLINES' special
       keyword to the #include line.
       [Many Debian people]

    *) Improve wml::des::navbar (16-Sep-2000):
       By default (called `inner' mode), epilog is put after sub-menu
       buttons, i.e. navbars are nested.  When <navbar:render> is called
       with attribute `menumode=outer', then sub-menus are inserted after
       epilog.
       [Tobias Oetiker]

    *) Make wml_p7_htmlfix customizable (16-Sep-2000):
       Two new options let the user decide which fixups are performed
       or skipped.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_p7_htmlfix (13-Sep-2000):
       The version shipped with WML 2.0.3 is broken, there are problems
       with unquoted attributes containing a slash sign.
       [Roland Rosenfeld]

    *) Support w3m in addition to lynx in wmd (13-Sep-2000):
       The wmd command now searches through $PATH for w3m and lynx (and
       prefers w3m over lynx) instead of insisting on the existence of lynx.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgraded to LinkLint 2.2 (10-Sep-2000):
       Upgraded from LinkLint version 1.35 to version 2.2 after LinkLint
       changed from a (for WML not acceptable) shareware license to GPL.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall, James B. Bowlin <bowlin@sirius.com>]

  Changes between 2.0.2 and 2.0.3:

    *) Fix compilation of ePerl with threaded Perl 5.6.0 (03-Sep-2000):
       Providing portable code amongst several versions of Perl is a
       nightmare, functions prototypes and macros definitions have
       changed again.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_intro.pod (03-Sep-2000):
       It contains an erroneous reference to </define-container>
       [Benoit des Ligneris <benoit.des.ligneris@physique.usherb.ca>]

    *) Upgrade to mp4h 1.1.1 (31-Aug-2000):
       This release fixes many bugs added in mp4h 1.1.0 about non-ASCII
       letters.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix problems with @-sign in some module files (29-Aug-2000):
       The <perl:assign> tag is replaced by <perl:assign:sq> to prevent
       a problem with @-sign in input text.
       [Stephane Bortzmeyer]

    *) Upgrade to Slice 1.3.7 (29-Aug-2000):
       Fix a bug with Slice 1.3.6, which hangs up with some input files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix compilation of Bit::Vector with perl < 5.005 (29-Aug-2000):
       [Max H. Duenki]

    *) Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.1 (08-Aug-2000):
       Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.1. This especially fixed problems
       with "shtool version" under Solaris.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgrade of tidy (06-Aug-2000):
       Upgraded tidy from version 8jul00 to 04aug00.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_p1_ipp (05-Aug-2000):
       Pass 1 hangs when a dollar sign appears in variable substitution.
       [Joey Smith <joey@joeysmith.com>]

    *) New variables WML_SRC_TIME and WML_GEN_TIME (04-Aug-2000):
       These variables ease customizing date formats.
       [Fritz Zaucker]

    *) Add alternative for mouse events (03-Aug-2000):
       The onmouseover and onmouseout event handlers are seconded
       by onfocus and onblur, to allow rendering with any device.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add `summary' attribute in tables (03-Aug-2000):
       This tag is automatically added by wml_p7_htmlfix, because
       it helps rendering by non-graphical browser, exactly like
       ALT attribute for <img>.
       [Stephan Petersen]

    *) Fix protection in wml (01-Aug-2000):
       Output files are generated by wml_p9_slice.  This program has
       a useful feature, output file names may be specified in
       pseudo shebang lines.  But these lines may occur anywhere in
       input file, not only on its beginning.
       As wml has to know which files are generated to unprotect them
       after pass 9, input file must be parsed before wml_p9_slice is
       called to determine output files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Allow nestable <protect> tags (31-Jul-2000):
       This tag is now much more user-friendly, it may be nested, and
       its syntax is similar to the -p flag, i.e. it accepts also a comma
       separated list of individual passes.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve processing speed on large files (30-Jul-2000):
       On large files, most of processing time is spent in
       passes 7, 8 and 9.  This performance problem is induced by
       Perl, which does not seem to work efficiently with regular
       expressions on huge datas.  The provided solution is to split
       input into smaller chunks.
       This procedure is quite conservative, i.e. it is not fully
       optimized to ensure that output is never altered by this
       operation.
       A speedup factor of 10 is obtained on those 3 passes with
       files larger than 200KB (which may be caused by a huge input
       file splitted into many HTML output files).
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of Bit::Vector (24-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded Bit::Vector from version 5.7 to 5.8.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Update all WML module files for XHTML 1.0 (21-Jul-2000):
       In WML module files, all simple tags have now a trailing
       backslash to allow both HTML and XHTML input and output.
       It is important to notice that this does not break compatibility,
       output is exactly the same by default.  But now users can decide
       which syntax to adopt via the -X flag of wml_p2_mp4h.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add support for modifiers in regexps in wml_p2_mp4h (21-Jul-2000):
       Only i, m, s and x modifiers have been added, U and X are
       specific to PCRE and have not been implemented.
       The `singleline' attribute has been changed.  It now accepts
       two values, `true' (like the s modifier) and `false' (like the
       m modifier).  Until now, `m' was the default, and singleline=true
       switches to `s'.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Finish import of PCRE in wml_p2_mp4h (21-Jul-2000):
       Native API is now used, and support for locales is back.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Many fixes for multilingual navbars (21-Jul-2000):
       Some bugs were introduced by recent changes in wml::std::tags
       and wml::des::navbar.
       [Stephan Petersen]

    *) Improve wml::std::lang (20-Jul-2000):
       Thanks to PCRE, <lang:area> has been rewritten entirely with
       mp4h commands, so now all lang tags can be nested.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Use Perl regular expressions in wml_p2_mp4h (20-Jul-2000):
       The PCRE library is copyrighted by University of Cambridge.
       With this library, Perl regular expressions may now be
       used instead of POSIX regular expressions.
       Current implementation in mp4h is quite weak, because we use
       the POSIX compatibility mode instead of native API.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve <javascript> tag in wml::std::tags (19-Jul-2000):
       When a complex <head> tag is defined, like in wml::std::page,
       all JavaScript material is passed to this command in order to
       be put inside the HEAD section.
       This behaviour is disabled with the `nohead' attribute or by
       defining <javascript:nohead> with a non-empty value.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_p1_ipp (19-Jul-2000):
       Previous changes broke `make test'.
       [Stephan Petersen]

    *) Improve wml::std::lang (19-Jul-2000):
       Language slices can now be nested, the reason is to allow
       constructs like ``<en><lang:star:href: index.*.html></en>''.
       This can not be easily handled by wml_p9_slice (any suggestions
       to do so are welcome), and so wml::std::lang has been patched
       to forbid nesting of different languages by redefining <en>,
       <lang:en> tags (and of course all other defined languages) and
       all <lang:star...> tags.
       Unfortunately multi-lingual zones enclosed between <lang:area>
       and </lang:area> do not yet allow this nesting.
       Two new tags are introduced, <lang:current> always returns
       the language being currently processed, and <lang:list> returns
       the newline separated list of defined languages.
       [Stefan `Sec` Zehl]

    *) Fix file name and line numbers on warnings (18-Jul-2000):
       Pass 1 now prints some control sequences to let pass 2 and 3
       know about original filename and line number instead of
       locations in temporary files.  This is very useful for debugging.
       It can be turned out with -W1,-N flag.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix a bug when using both -M and -W1 flags (16-Jul-2000):
       Options set with -W1,... were not passed to wml_p1_ipp.
       [Ilya Martynov <m_ilya@agava.com>]

    *) Upgrade of the Bare Bones Guide to HTML (13-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded from version 3.0 to 4.0.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of tidy (13-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded tidy from version 30nov99 to 8jul00.
       Dave Raggett included submitted patches to make gcc quiet,
       so only few changes have been made in upstream sources.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Internal changes in mp4h about regular expressions (06-Jul-2000):
       Mp4h now uses the POSIX functions of the GNU libc regex.c instead
       of old GNU functions.  The most important reason for this change
       is that previous functions are not documented, and so hard to
       maintain.
       Moreover i had to patch the regex functions to allow the
       ``singleline=true'' attribute.
       With this new version it works out of the box, and many memory
       leaks are also fixed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix boolean operators (05-Jul-2000):
       The <and> tag was broken, and <or> has been cleaned up.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve <preserve>/<restore> stuff (05-Jul-2000):
       These tags accept now any number of arguments, so it is possible
       to write
           <define-tag foo>
           <preserve name src text>
           <set-var %attributes>
           ... code using `name', `src' and `text' variables.
           <restore  name src text>
           </define-tag>
       All module files have been updated in consequence.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix whitespace in wml::des::preload (03-Jul-2000):
       The javascript code was not protected against newlines removal,
       and resulting code is ugly.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Rewrite wml::*::all files (03-Jul-2000):
       These modules include all files from a specific category.
       When inclusion is made with wildcards, some files which have been
       removed from WML distribution, but were not deleted by user when
       upgrading, may be called accidentally.  So they now explicitly
       invoke the desired files.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.0 (01-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.0. This involved especially a major
       adjustment because of the rewritten "shtool version" command.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Enhanced wml::std::tags' <javascript> tag (27-Jun-2000):
       Added four additional attributes to the <javascript> container
       tag of wml::std::tags: "src", "language" and "type" to directly
       specify the corresponding attributes for the underlaying <script>
       tag, and "version" which is a convinient attribute to specify the
       JavaScript version as used in the default "language" attribute.
       Example: ``<javascript version=1.2 src=foo.js>'' now expands
       into ``<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"
       src="foo.js">...</script>''
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix wml::sys::all manpage (27-Jun-2000):
       The wml::sys::all manpage talked about no longer existing
       wml::sys::xxx includes.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix escaped quotes in wml::std::href (24-Jun-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix <divert> in wml::std::tags (24-Jun-2000):
       It was impossible to use exclamation marks with this tag
       as described in wml_p5_divert.
       [Fritz Zaucker]

  Changes between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2:

    *) Update mp4h (22-Jun-2000):
       New version is mp4h 1.0.2, with many enhancements since pre-1.0
       releases.  The most important one is that `grammar' has been
       entirely rethought.  After discussions on the WML mailing-list
       it is clear that users want tag expansion mechanism to be simple.
       Unfortunately, because WML runs many independant passes, each
       one with its own syntax, i could not provide a simple mechanism.
       But i try to keep it as simple as possible.
       Last but not least, this new version makes WML 2.0.2 much more
       compatible with WML 1.x than previous WML 2.x releases, and
       optional features allow experienced users to deal with either
       HTML or XHTML files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove stars in tag names (15-Jun-2000):
       The wml script now removes stars after and before tag names.
       Read mp4h documentation to learn why this is needed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::std::grid (15-Jun-2000):
       An error was raised with arrobas sign in cells.
       [<middelink@polyware.nl>]

    *) Fix wml_p8_htmlstrip (15-Jun-2000):
       The <suck> tag may now be written <suck/> or <suck /> to conform
       to new standards.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::fmt::verbatim (08-Jun-2000):
       This module was compromised because of nested protection tags,
       which are not valid yet.
       [Howard Alexander LaHurreau <alexdw@locl.net>]

    *) Fix wml::des::typography (07-Jun-2000):
       The <spaced> tag was broken.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix documentation of wml::std::page (02-Jun-2000):
       The WML_PAGE_* slices are actually WML_STDPAGE_* and
       are only available if the "slices" attribute is used.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix wml::std::lang (01-Jun-2000):
       It was broken with default wildcard.
       [Corsin Decurtins <corsin@student.ethz.ch>]

    *) Fix compilation bug in wml_p2_mp4h (01-Jun-2000):
       [<gaa@ulticom.com>]

    *) Provide a way to read tokens without parsing (01-Jun-2000):
       All characters between <@[ and ]@> are read without parsing,
       this is very useful to read malformed mp4h tags.  These
       delimiters may be changed with the <set-quotes> tag.
       [Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch>]

    *) Fix wml_p8_htmlstrip (31-May-2000):
       Pass 8 preserves whitespace inside <pre>, <xmp> or <nostrip>
       complex tags.  When these tags have attributes, whitespaces were
       removed.
       [Tom Gilbert <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>]

  Changes between 2.0.0 and 2.0.1:

    *) Add missing documentation in wml::des::typography (23-May-2000):
       The <tul> and <tli> macros were not documented.
       [Franz Knipp, Alvise Belotti]

    *) Fix WMd (23-May-2000):
       Installation path of WML manpages is searched before $MANPATH,
       and not after.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Numerous bugfixes and clean-ups in include files (23-May-2000):
       Perl code in include files must be protected against expansion
       during pass 2 because some constructs are now parsed (take great
       care of left-angle brackets).
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change evaluation of unknown tags (22-May-2000):
       Until WML 2.0.0, unknown tags are treated like normal text,
       i.e. left angle bracket lose their special meaning.  This has
       very strange side effects when such tags appear in attributes.
       This feature has been discarded so that old pages still compile.
       [many people]

    *) Fix installation of preformatted manpages (22-May-2000):
       An undocumented change in Makefiles installed preformatted
       manpages under $(mandir)/manX instead of $(mandir)/catX. By
       default the subdirectory name is now again `cat', but can
       overridden via the new --with-catdir configure option
       (usually one would use --with-catdir=man).
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix wml_p2_mp4h documentation (16-May-2000):
       Some French words were present in English version.
       [Franz Knipp]

    *) Fix wml::std::tags to remove extra newlines (16-May-2000):
       Because of the definition of <perl:print>, some extra newlines
       was added.
       [Franz Knipp]
