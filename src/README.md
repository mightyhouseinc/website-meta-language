WML is a free and extensible Webdesigner's off-line HTML generation
toolkit for Unix, distributed under the GNU General Public License
(GPL v2). It is written in C and Perl 5, built via a CMake
based source tree and should run on most Unix-like operating systems
and on [cygwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin).

While still maintained due to its use by several users, and while it
is flexible, WML is not recommended for new projects due to the fact it
seems to be relatively slow. You are probably better off using a
different [static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) .

Some WML resources on the WWW are:

* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/thewml/website-meta-language)

The marketing verbiage from the old README read:

<blockquote>

<p>
WML consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends in a
sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each backend provides one
particular core language. For maximum power WML additionally ships
with a well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level
features build on top of the backends core languages. While not
trivial and idiot proof WML provides most of the core features real
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hackers</a> always wanted for HTML generation.
